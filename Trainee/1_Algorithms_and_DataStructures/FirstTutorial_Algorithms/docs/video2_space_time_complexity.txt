Speed of an algorithm

Space Complexity
How much memory is used

Time Complexity
How many primitive operations are executed?

...with respect to input size
...and assuming worst case scenarios

Problem:
Given a list of hotels, return the price
range of hotels in a given result

The more data we have, the more longer
it will take to show the min and max required
for the range

As the dataset grows, the cost can grow really fast
or really slow

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
Approach 1: Compare all numbers to one another

N^2 = "N" is the hotels' number and 2 is the amount of work
the rate will increase
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
Approach 2: Track min & max : 
Find min, and find max numbers

2N = Because as the data grows, the amount of work increases
by 2
* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * 
Approach 3: Sorted list
Find first, find last
