Stack = Stores items in "A last in, first-out" -> ( LIFO ) order
Queue = Stores items in "A first in, first-out" -> ( FIFO ) order

Stack -> Inserts values since 0 and remove values since the very last one
Queue -> Inserts values since 0 and remove values since 0

Pros -> Fast operations

Javascript -> Stack === Array

Enqueue -> Inserting values to a queue
Dequeue -> Taking values of from a queue
