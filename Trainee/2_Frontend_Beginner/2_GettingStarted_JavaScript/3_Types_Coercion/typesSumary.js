/*
Like every other operation, is coercion helpful
in an equality comparison or not

==  is not about comparison 
    with unknown types

=== is about comparisons with
    known type(s), optionally
    where conversions are helpful

"You simply cannot write quality
JS programs without knowing the types
involved in your operations"
