/* 
A quality JS program embraces coercions, making sure the types involved in every operation are clear 

If a feature is sometimes useful and sometimes dangerous and if there is a better option then always
use the better option

Useful: When the reader is focused on what's important
Dangerous: When the reader can't tell what will happen
Better: When the reader understands the code
