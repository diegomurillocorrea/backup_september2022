*** _.each / forEach DEFINED ***

_.each(
    [ "observatory", "ballroom", "library" ],
    function( value, index, list ) { ... } ;
);

[ "observatory", "ballroom", "library" ]
.forEach( function( value, index, list ) { ... } );

• Iterates over a list of elements, passing the values to a function.
• Each invocation of iterator, the function, is called with three arguments:
( element, index, list ). If list is a JavaScript object, iterator's arguments will be
( value, key, list )

each -> Looping through lists

each vs forEach -> Readability

The underscore refers to an object, because before the each function there is a dot
_.each
